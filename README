Lavish

About:

A basic framework for 2d and 3d game development using SDL, OpenGL and GLEW. Lavish is a continuation of the snagle engine that I created awhile back (see http://code.google.com/p/snagle ).

The engine is cross-platform however there is only xcode/mac and Makefile/linux project file at the moment. A windows project will be coming sometime in the future (when the demand is high enough).

Goals:

-Cross-platform, modern game framework.
-A set of tools to ease of creating resource.
-Enough scripting capabilities to create a full game without touching native code.
